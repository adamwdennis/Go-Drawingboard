Go-Drawingboard is a multi-user whiteboard, powered by [GoInstant](http://www.goinstant.com/) and
based on [drawingboard.js](https://github.com/Leimi/drawingboard.js).

Go-Drawingboard makes it super easy to draw with friends or colleagues in a realtime environment.

We use drawingboard.js for the core whiteboard app, and then integrated GoInstant into it for the
realtime, multi-user collaboration.
